Al Mamsha stands as Sharjah’s latest attraction and the first fully pedestrian-friendly neighborhood, blending modern lifestyle, retail, and leisure in an upscale, tech-integrated environment. This community offers residents a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in a contemporary, vibrant atmosphere at Nama, where modern living meets refined aesthetics.

## **Distinctive Living Experience at Nama**

Nama provides an exceptional living experience through elegantly designed homes, fostering a true sense of belonging. As a resident, you’ll have access to a luxurious lifestyle within an exclusive community that offers unmatched features and amenities. Nama is thoughtfully developed to attract those seeking a vibrant, upscale lifestyle, featuring smart technology, premium residences, and an inviting ambiance in a prime location.

## **Exterior Architecture and Sustainable Design**

The architecture of Nama combines traditional construction techniques, including the use of column and PT slabs, with insulated blockwork facades and roofing systems. This robust design provides outstanding resistance to fire and natural disasters. Additionally, the placement of buildings is strategically planned to promote natural ventilation, optimizing wind flow and redirecting fresh air. By taking advantage of varying air pressure points, this design reduces energy consumption while enhancing comfort.

Open layouts supported by expansive glass walls enhance the interiors, creating an illusion of larger spaces and offering residents a more open, airy feel.

Nama’s interiors are equipped with state-of-the-art ventilation and air-conditioning systems that enhance indoor air quality while optimizing energy efficiency. The residential units are distinguished by 3.2-meter-high ceilings, lending a sophisticated touch and a spacious feel throughout each home.

## **Luxurious Features and Community Amenities**

- **Flooring and Pools:** Solid ceramic flooring throughout and multiple expansive swimming pools, alongside a dedicated waterpark for children, provide residents with both luxury and recreational options.

- **Advanced Security and Automation:** The building's elevators adhere to international safety standards, with a network of CCTV cameras monitored from a central security hub. Each apartment features a home automation system, smoke control, and firefighting systems, providing both safety and convenience.

- **Smart Technology and Italian Design:** Italian-designed bathrooms and premium tile flooring are found throughout each unit. Smart switches, a home automation control panel, and mobile app integration add modern convenience, allowing residents to control various home functions seamlessly.

- **Spacious Views and Practical Facilities:** Elegantly crafted windows offer park views, while thoughtfully designed and fitted wardrobes enhance storage. Residents also benefit from shaded pedestrian sidewalks and underground parking facilities, ensuring convenience and comfort at every level.

Developed by BEYOND, a distinguished real estate brand under the esteemed OMNIYAT GROUP, this development seamlessly blends architectural excellence, sustainable innovation, and luxury living. Offering a diverse range of residential options, Orise features 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, chalets, and penthouses with private rooftop terraces, catering to different lifestyles and family needs. Unit sizes range from 64 m² (690 sqft) to 135 m² (1,453 sqft). Buyers can take advantage of a convenient 50/50 payment plan, requiring just a 10% down payment, with the balance payable during construction. The project is set for handover in Q1 2028, presenting a promising opportunity for both end-users and investors.

The development boasts breathtaking views of the Arabian Gulf while being strategically positioned close to Dubai’s key business, entertainment, and cultural districts. Its central location ensures easy connectivity, with Mina Rashid just 3 minutes away, Downtown Dubai and DIFC within 12 minutes, and Dubai International Airport a mere 10-minute drive, making travel within and beyond the city effortless.

## **Sophisticated Design and Thoughtful Interiors**

Orise distinguishes itself with a contemporary architectural approach, premium finishes, and a commitment to sustainability. Every residence is carefully designed to exude elegance and comfort, featuring open-plan layouts that amplify space and natural light. High-quality materials, floor-to-ceiling windows, and seamless indoor-outdoor integration create an airy and inviting ambiance.

The project’s luxurious design, sustainable approach, and excellent connectivity are expected to yield strong returns on investment (ROI), appealing to both homeowners and investors alike.

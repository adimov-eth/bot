The Oasis Address Branded Villas represent an elite residential offering by the globally acclaimed Emaar Properties. As part of Phase 3A within The Oasis master-planned community, this ultra-luxurious project is being developed under the Address Hotels + Resorts brand, renowned for setting benchmarks in luxury hospitality and exceptional service. Marking the first of its kind in the emirate, the Address Branded Villas bring five-star living to the comfort of private residences, adhering to the signature quality standards of Address.  

**Exclusive Villa Configurations and Interior Features**  

The villas at Address Branded Villas in The Oasis are available in multiple premium configurations, including Luxury, Exquisite, and Ultra Luxury. These residences offer expansive layouts ranging from 4 to 6 bedrooms, with built-up areas spanning from 7,269 sq. ft. (675 m²) to 12,777 sq. ft. (1,187 m²). All villas feature two floors and are equipped with private elevators, while select units also include a basement and/or a landscaped rooftop.  

Designed with the finest materials, these homes boast marble flooring, wooden paneling, and designer bathroom fittings. The kitchens are fully equipped with high-end appliances, ensuring a seamless blend of functionality and sophistication. While the villas are delivered unfurnished, buyers have the flexibility to personalize the interiors to reflect their individual style.  

**A Masterfully Planned Gated Community**  

Nestled within The Oasis, a vast 850-hectare gated community, Address Branded Villas offer a serene and picturesque living environment. Over 25% of the area is dedicated to water features and lush green spaces, with scenic canals enhancing the landscape. A key highlight of this development is its low-density layout, accommodating only 3,100 residential units for an exclusive and spacious living experience.  

The community is designed to provide world-class amenities, including private beaches, infinity-edge pools, state-of-the-art fitness centers, spa facilities, waterfront promenades, children's play areas, and fine-dining establishments.  

**Prime Connectivity and Nearby Landmarks**

Strategically positioned, Emaar Oasis Address Branded Villas offer excellent connectivity to key destinations in Dubai. Al Maktoum International Airport is a 20-minute drive, while Downtown Dubai is accessible within 25 minutes and Dubai Marina within 35 minutes. Residents will also find major shopping destinations such as Dubai Hills Mall and Cityland Mall just 10–15 minutes away, along with renowned schools and private healthcare facilities in the Dubailand district.

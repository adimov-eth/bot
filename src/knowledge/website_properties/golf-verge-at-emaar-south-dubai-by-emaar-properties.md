Emaar Properties is set to unveil Golf Verge, a new residential development located within the Emaar South community in Dubai. This project is part of a larger master plan that seamlessly integrates contemporary urban living with natural landscapes.

Golf Verge at Emaar South will feature a total of 204 residences, comprising 1, 2, and 3-bedroom apartments. The unit sizes vary, starting from 797 sq. ft. (74 m²) for a one-bedroom apartment, 1,308 sq. ft. (122 m²) for a two-bedroom, and extending up to 1,683 sq. ft. (156 m²) for a three-bedroom unit. The completion of this development is anticipated in Q2 2029. Emaar Properties offers an attractive 80/20 payment plan, interest-free, with an initial down payment requirement of 10%.

## **Architectural Design and Interior Features**

Golf Verge showcases a modern architectural aesthetic, featuring expansive panoramic windows that provide stunning views of the adjacent golf course. The apartments are designed with spacious terraces, high-quality finishes, and well-planned layouts to ensure comfort and functionality. Interiors incorporate light hues and natural textures, creating a bright and inviting ambiance. The open-plan kitchens are equipped with premium appliances and optimized storage solutions for enhanced convenience.

## **Exclusive Amenities and Facilities**

Residents of Golf Verge will have access to an extensive range of premium amenities, including dedicated swimming pools for adults and children, a splash pad, state-of-the-art gyms, and designated indoor and outdoor yoga spaces. A children’s playroom further enhances the family-friendly environment. The development also features lush green walkways and recreational spaces, while Emaar South itself offers a variety of public parks, shopping centers, restaurants, and cafés in close proximity.

## **Well-Developed Infrastructure and Connectivity**

Emaar South is a thriving community with a robust infrastructure, offering numerous schools, healthcare centers, retail destinations, and sports facilities. The neighborhood is designed with cycling and walking trails, catering to an active lifestyle. Residents also have access to world-class golf courses, tennis courts, and expansive parks.

The location is well-connected, with direct access to major highways, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) and Emirates Road. Future expansion of the transport network is anticipated, with potential metro stations being considered. Key landmarks are easily accessible, with Dubai International Airport just 10 minutes away, Dubai Marina approximately 30 minutes away, and Downtown Dubai reachable within 35 minutes.

## **Investment Potential and Market Growth**

The real estate market in Emaar South continues to demonstrate strong growth, making properties in this community a lucrative investment.

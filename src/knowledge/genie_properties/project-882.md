The project configuration includes two levels of underground car parks, a mezzanine level, 10 residential floors and a rooftop.

The project includes studios and one and two bedroom apartments. The interiors are designed with premium finishes and high quality fittings. Each flat comes with a fully equipped kitchen, creating a comfortable living space.

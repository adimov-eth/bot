## Description
Côtier House 2 is a masterpiece located on Dubai Islands, a 13-story residential building including a ground floor and 2 parking levels. The architectural concept of Côtier House 2 is an ode to the ocean: distinctive, ocean-inspired curves create a sense of connection that only a “home” can provide. The complex offers 1, 2, and 3-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom townhouses and penthouses, as well as 3 and 4-bedroom duplexes. In each residential unit, a carefully curated palette of materials creates harmonious functionality in an open-plan layout. Panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light, which is reflected and diffused throughout the interior. Flowing lines combined with crisp angular forms create an atmosphere of softness and comfort. And balconies offer breathtaking panoramic sea views.

Côtier House 2 offers its residents luxurious amenities: a hotel-style lobby, multiple swimming pools (including an infinity pool), a clubhouse, a modern fitness center, business zones, and electric vehicle charging stations.

The location allows you to experience seclusion from the hustle and bustle of the city, while being just minutes from key business, transportation, and entertainment hubs in Dubai: 10 minutes to Gold Souq, 20 minutes to Dubai International Airport and The Dubai Frame, 24 minutes to Dubai World Trade Centre and Downtown Dubai, 33 minutes to Business Bay.

## Description
Pearl House is an 11-story architectural masterpiece nestled amidst the greenery and developed infrastructure of Jumeirah Village Circle. Here you’ll find luxurious residences ranging from functional studios to spacious one-bedroom apartments, each with a unique design. The white building with its flowing balcony lines and strict symmetry resembles a luxurious 5-star hotel. Inside the apartments, you’ll be greeted with exquisite interior design, thoughtful layouts, panoramic windows that flood the space with natural light, and breathtaking views from the balconies. The developer has taken care of every detail, equipping the apartments with premium finishes, top-of-the-line plumbing, a “Smart Home” system, a personal Samsung TV, and an iMac computer.

For your comfort, the complex offers a modern gym, swimming pools for adults and children (including a rooftop pool), children’s playgrounds, sports courts, a barbecue area, a club lounge with billiards tables, and charging stations for electric vehicles.

The location of Pearl House is also an undeniable advantage: it’s close to schools, medical facilities, cafes and restaurants, entertainment centers, parks, and supermarkets. Convenient access to a transportation hub allows for quick travel to Dubai’s best attractions. For example, the Dubai Marina with its waterfront and yacht moorings is just a 15-minute drive away.

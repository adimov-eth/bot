## Description
Palmiera The Oasis is a luxury project from developer Emaar Properties, located in The Oasis area, Dubai.  Consisting of 4-bedroom villas, these homes are carefully designed to prioritize comfort, well-being and a deep connection to stunning nature. Efficient layouts maximize views of water channels and public areas, allowing residents to enjoy the scenic scenery from the comfort of their homes. The interiors reflect modern elegance, combining high-quality materials and finishes to create a refined and inviting atmosphere.

The villas of the complex are surrounded by green spaces, residents have access to a private beach and swimming pools. The complex also provides children's and sports grounds, a spa center and a park to meet the diverse needs of residents.

Palmiera The Oasis has a strategically advantageous location: the complex is located between two important routes of Dubai-Sheikh Zayed Bin Hamdan Al Nahyan Street and Yalayis Street. Along these highways, residents can easily reach anywhere in Dubai. Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall, the largest shopping center, are both 40 minutes away by car. The popular waterfront area of Dubai Marina, with its marina and boardwalk, is a 20-minute drive away, while the world's largest airport, Al Maktoum International Airport, is just a 15-minute drive away.

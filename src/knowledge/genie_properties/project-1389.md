## Description
Velora is a stunning collection of townhouses that represent the true epitome of luxury and comfort amidst the green spaces and cozy parks of The Valley. The development is part of Emaar's ambitious The Valley Phase 2 project.

 The project includes townhouses with three and four bedrooms. Each house has an amazing architecture in a modern style, and thanks to the use of high-quality finishing materials in delicate colors, the complex fits perfectly into the surrounding picturesque nature.

 Among the amenities of the complex each resident will be able to find something to their liking. For recreation there are park areas, recreational areas and walking paths. Sports lovers can use the gym or play on the tennis court, basketball court or playground. Children can play on the playground, and there is a separate walking area for pets. All this is complemented by relief landscapes and incredibly beautiful nature.

 The advantage of the complex is its convenient location. Despite its remote location from the center of Dubai, the complex is connected to Al Ain Road, which provides access to the city's iconic places. 5 minutes away is the Rugby Sevens Stadium, 8 minutes away is the Dubai Outlet Mall, and 25 minutes away are the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai, where you can find world-class restaurants and unique stores. Dubai International Airport is also just 25 minutes away.

## Description
Wellington Ocean is a unique project that rises against the backdrop of the magnificent ocean, embodying life on the coast. The six-storey waterfront building from developer Wellington attracts attention with its clean, modern lines and wide glass panels that create a dynamic play of light and shadow. 

Apartments with 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms are available for sale. The lobby, foyer and lobby bar create a single space filled with urban elegance. From marble surfaces and calm lighting to the impeccable functionality of high-speed elevators â€” each space reflects the charm of the coastal area and modern style.

Wellington Ocean redefines the concept of a coastal getaway with a lively catwalk and rooftop amenities. On the podium there are changing cabins, a swimming pool, children's water attractions, a playground, mini golf and a recreation area.

The project is located on Dubai Islands, which allows you to get to Deira City Centre in just 5 minutes, to Dubai International Airport in 19 minutes, and to Downtown in 30 minutes.

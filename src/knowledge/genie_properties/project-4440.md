## Description
Costa Mare is a luxury waterfront development on Al Marjan Island, Ras Al Khaimah, by Ellington Properties. Four towers rising to the top form an elegant architectural ensemble. The first, a sixteen-story tower, offers fifteen floors of living space and two underground levels. The other three towers each have twenty residential floors and two underground levels hidden from view. A special feature of the complex is its unique landscaping, which takes up an entire floor. Thanks to this, each residence boasts impressive panoramic views of the bay. There are over 900 meticulously designed residences: 1-4 bedroom apartments, exclusive beach villas and impressive six-bedroom penthouses. All residences are characterized by modern interiors, and high-tech “smart home” solutions provide maximum comfort and convenience.

Costa Mare is an amazing place where you can enjoy the beauty of nature and relax from the hustle and bustle of the city. Residents of the project can enjoy swimming pools, saunas, yoga studios, barbecue area and children's playgrounds. A private beach with sea breeze is provided for recreation.

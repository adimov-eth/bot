The configuration includes two basement levels, a ground floor, three podium floors, and nineteen levels of office spaces.

The offices offer breathtaking views of the Dubai Canal, making workdays more inspiring.

Tenants have access to a fully equipped gym, a dedicated aerobics room, shaded running tracks, and walking paths around the building.

The tower is conveniently located near major city highways. It takes only 9 minutes to reach Dubai Mall, 20 minutes to Palm Jumeirah, 19 minutes to Burj Al Arab, and 24 minutes to The Walk JBR.

## Description
Century is a premial high-rise residential complex produced by fäm Master Agency, located in Dubai's modern Business Bay. The project designed by AMBS Real Estate Development. It consist of 23-storey residential floors. The architecture of the complex follows the same design as the neighboring residential projects: a tower in a delicate Gainsborough shade with clean lines of the facade is complemented by panoramic windows and a multi-level podium with decorative slatted panels.

Apartments with 1 or 2 bedrooms and studios are available for purchase. All residences are finished in restrained light colors and are also equipped with a white kitchen unit, shower, dressing tables and shelves in the bathrooms. Textured wood-look tiles soften the severity of white.

The complex's amenities and services include an outdoor rooftop pool, a relaxation area and an indoor gym. A landscaped area with landscape design was also thought out so that even the heart of the metropolis would not interfere with enjoying nature.

The road from Century to the central Downtown area with the Burj Khalifa skyscraper and to the Dubai Mall, is just 5 minutes by car. The Business Bay Marina with yacht clubs where you can moor your yacht and a shopping and restaurant promenade where you can diversify your leisure time is a 10-minute walk away. It takes 20 and 35 minutes to reach Dubai International Airport and Al Maktoum International Airport respectively.

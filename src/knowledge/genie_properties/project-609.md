## Description
Terra Golf Collection is an exclusive collection of 84 luxury villas and townhouses located in the vibrant Jumeirah Golf Estates. Each residence is the epitome of contemporary design, functionality and luxury. The architecture is dominated by straight lines and geometric precision, resulting in a visually striking aesthetic. The design emphasizes details and natural eco-materials: glass, steel and natural plaster. Large windows and sliding glass doors provide unobstructed views of the verdant landscape, while private terraces and balconies become an extension of the living spaces, allowing residents to immerse themselves in the tranquility of the natural surroundings.

Each residence has a modular kitchen with built-in appliances and the ability to equip individual villas with an individual private cinema, gym and bar. Amenities include two golf courses, parks, playgrounds and sports fields. Residents can have a pleasant time in the wellness center, relax in the pool, exercise on modern exercise equipment in the gym or on the tennis court. There is a safe play area and a separate swimming pool for children.

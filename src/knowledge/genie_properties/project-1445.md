## Description
Zuha Island is a secluded resort complex by ZAYA Companies in the World Islands.

The luxurious 4-storey villas are located on the picturesque seashore, surrounded by lush landscaped gardens. The exteriors of the buildings, using curves and streamlined contours, emphasise the shape of the island itself. 

Utilising high-end natural materials such as travertine and marble, Zuha Island's ultra-modern villas will look as sophisticated and luxurious as possible. Each residence features 4 unique levels that rise from the shoreline to the vast horizon, and will be centred around a spiral staircase. 

Future residents of the project will be able to enjoy a host of unrivalled amenities without leaving their signature residence, including: 4 residential levels, garage/storage, panoramic lift, 3 staff rooms, infinity pool, deck leading to the coast, prep and show kitchens, swimming pool with beach seating and BBQ area, numerous terraces including a roof terrace on both the island and bay sides. 

The project is located just 15 minutes from the coast of Jumeirah Beach. Once on the Dubai mainland, it takes just 15 minutes to reach the centre of the emirate, Downtown Dubai. Dubai International Airport and Al Maktoum International Airport are a 20 and 40 minute drive respectively.

## Description
Bloom Living Cordoba, the first phase of the Bloom Living development, is a limited collection of 257 stylish 2-3 bedroom townhouses and 3-6 bedroom villas.

Bloom Living Cordoba has dedicated pet parks, swimming pools, a beach club, a health club, a sports club, tennis courts, a yoga area, jogging tracks, and children's playgrounds.

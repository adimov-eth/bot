## Description
Eden Hills is an exceptional community developed by developer H&H Development in Dubai Hills, Dubai.

The project consists of 327 villas and plots designed with serenity and privacy in mind. Available in five different types of residences, each residence, five and six-bedroom villas are exquisite embodiments of contemporary design on spacious plots. Pedestrianised streets, open spaces and large verdant gardens make Eden Hills an active place for family life. And with large windows and spacious interiors, each villa has an organic simplicity; it is exquisitely designed, beautifully appointed and quality built. 

Green spaces and walkways, as well as shaded seating areas, create endless opportunities to socialise with like-minded people. Adjacent to the gated entrance is a welcoming community centre that serves as a gathering place.

Eden Hills is thoughtfully located in a location that combines peace and quiet with easy access to Dubai city centre, entertainment venues, everyday amenities and much more. This quiet new neighbourhood is close to Dubai's motorway network, allowing residents quick access to everything the city has to offer. For example, Jumeirah Beach and Dubai Downtown are only 20-25 minutes away, Dubai Marina is a 25-30 minute drive, and International Airport can be reached in 35-40 minutes.

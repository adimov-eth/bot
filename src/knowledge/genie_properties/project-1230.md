## Description
Address Residences Zabeel is a project by Emaar, located in the Zabeel community. The complex consists of four majestic 50-storey towers, each a masterpiece of contemporary design.

The glass façades of the towers reflect the modernism of the business district, while their softer edges create a subtle contrast, hinting at the tranquility of the nearby Zabeel Park. The architectural approach establishes a visual dialogue between the urban environment and natural beauty. The interiors of the 1–3 bedroom apartments and exclusive penthouses showcase the commitment of the Address Hotels + Resorts brand to excellence. Every detail is carefully selected to create warm and inviting living spaces.

At the podium level, the complex features a dynamic hub where residents can unwind in swimming pools or enjoy a fully equipped gym. This is complemented by an attractive retail area with cafés and shops, ensuring both convenience and luxury within easy reach.

Address Residences Zabeel is strategically located with direct access to major highways, offering seamless connectivity across Dubai. Nearby landmarks include Burj Khalifa, Dubai Frame, Zabeel Park, and major shopping destinations such as the iconic Dubai Mall.

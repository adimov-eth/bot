## Description
Porto View is a luxurious residential complex by Emaar, located in Mina Rashid. The project offers direct access to the marina and stunning waterfront views. The complex features exquisite 1–3-bedroom apartments as well as exclusive 3-bedroom townhouses.

The architectural concept of Porto View combines sleek façade lines, modern finishes, and attention to detail, creating a visually refined and comfortable living space. The building includes a ground level, a podium level, and two residential sections of 6 and 9 floors, each topped with its own roof.

The interiors are designed in a bright color palette, emphasizing elegant minimalism and an open-concept layout. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide abundant natural light and offer breathtaking views.

At Porto View, luxury is a way of life. Residents can relax in the infinity pool overlooking the harbor, work out in the state-of-the-art fitness center, or unwind in the lush green podium gardens. Children can enjoy dedicated play areas, while outdoor enthusiasts have access to barbecue zones and an open-air gym.

Thanks to its prime location in Rashid Yachts & Marina, Porto View ensures seamless access to Dubai’s major landmarks. Dubai International Airport, Downtown Dubai, Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, and Dubai Creek Harbour are all just 15–20 minutes away by car.

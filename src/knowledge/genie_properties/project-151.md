## Description
Reserve Villas is an exclusive collection of 4-6 bedroom villas located away from the hustle and bustle of the city in Wadi Al Safa 2. Each home has a stylish design and functional layouts to ensure comfortable living. Each residence offers views of the picturesque surroundings.

A significant part of the territory of the complex is planted with parks and forests. In the green zone, residents will be able to find places for recreation, pedestrian areas, jogging and bicycle paths, as well as a separate park for animals. Sobha is planting mature deciduous trees from its own nurseries, which provide more oxygen and shade. There are also a variety of sports fields, a clubhouse, and each villa is equipped with a private pool.

Reserve Villas is characterized by an increased attention to security. Entry is available only by pass. None of the residents of another neighborhood or a random tourist will not be able to enter the territory. 

One of the main features of the complex is its favorable location. From the community there is a direct exit to the Sheikh Bin Zayed highway. On it to the main districts of Dubai is only 20 minutes by car. The same amount of time it will take to reach such attractions as Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, The Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Frame, Dubai International Airport, Dubai Opera and Museum of the Future.

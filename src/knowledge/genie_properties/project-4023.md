## Description
Golf Edge is a modern project by Emaar, located in the Emaar South district. The building consists of a ground level, a podium level, and two residential sections with 9 and 12 floors, each topped with its own rooftop. The complex offers cozy 1- to 3-bedroom apartments as well as 3-bedroom townhouses.

The architecture of Golf Edge seamlessly blends modern minimalism with natural aesthetics. The building’s sleek façade integrates harmoniously with the surrounding landscape, while earthy tones in both the exterior and interior create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

The project provides ideal conditions for an active and comfortable lifestyle, featuring a community park, children's play areas, retail outlets, and an 18-hole golf course. Residents also have access to a clubhouse, a state-of-the-art fitness center, and multipurpose leisure and entertainment spaces.

Thanks to its prime location, Golf Edge ensures easy access to Dubai’s key destinations. Al Maktoum International Airport is just five minutes away, while Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina can be reached within 30–35 minutes. The drive to Abu Dhabi City Center takes approximately 50 minutes.

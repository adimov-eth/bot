## Description
Plaza 2 is a residential project from Reportage Properties. The complex comprises a ground floor and 5 residential levels and offers 1-bedroom apartments and studios and townhouses in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi.

This project is the result of the hard work of architects who were tasked with creating an eco-sustainable residential facility in the spirit of Masdar City. As a result, the district received an elite residential complex with energy â€” efficient buildings, solar panels and renewable energy sources, and local residents-a new object that attracts the eyes and complements the overall idea of an eco-city. Plaza 2 embodies the concept of a modern Arab city. A well-thought-out layout that will be appreciated by customers with any requests, high-quality finishes in soothing colors and first-class design in a modern style-this is the place where you want to live. 

The residential complex boasts all possible amenities in a strategic location connecting major roads, surrounded by parks, schools, mosques, banks and public shops. But the benefits for residents do not end there. In addition to the on-site swimming pools, the complex boasts an even distribution of natural light and a full range of amenities for a comfortable life. The property is just 5 minutes to Masdar Central Park, 7 minutes to Abu Dhabi Int. Airport, 15 minutes drive to Yas Island and Al Forsan Central Mall.

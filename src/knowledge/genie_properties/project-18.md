## Description

Shops, cafes and restaurants can be found in the immediate vicinity.

Dubai attractions such as the Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, Dubai Canal, Dubai Fountain and Dubai Opera are all within walking distance of DG1. The famous Dubai Miracle Garden and Dubai Butterfly Garden Parks are a 25 – minute drive away, while JBR Beach and Dubai Marina are a 30-minute drive away.

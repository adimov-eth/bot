## Description
Marina Vista is a luxury development by Emaar at Emaar Beachfront Island, consisting of two towers of 33 and 45 storeys. Bright by day and enchanting by night, each home is designed to offer panoramic views of the beautiful sea, Dubai Marina and the bay with sparkling yachts. The 1, 2, 3 and 4-bedroom residences, which maintain a connection to the sea and sandy shore, embody elegance in every detail and perfectly complement the beach setting.

The developed infrastructure of the complex provides residents with the most comfortable living. A beautifully located swimming pool or an equipped gym is the perfect place to relax after a long day's work and simply admire the view of the soothing sea. The waterfront offers a variety of world-class dining, shopping and entertainment venues less than a minute's walk away.

Marina Vista is located in one of the most prestigious locations on the Emaar Beachfront. It is one of the first residential developments at the entrance to the island and the closest to Dubai Marina, which is easily accessible on foot. It is also within easy reach of Sheikh Zayed Road, which takes approximately 20 minutes to Dubai International Airport and 45 minutes to Al Maktoum International Airport.

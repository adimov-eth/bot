## Description
Solea – a residential complex nestled in the heart of the prestigious Saadiyat Lagoons district in Abu Dhabi, where culture, nature, and luxury seamlessly converge. Four interconnected 7-story buildings, designed with a thoughtful linear approach, create a harmonious space. The tongue-and-groove layout of the buildings maximizes space efficiency and highlights architectural harmony. The well-thought-out apartment layouts ensure privacy by preventing direct views into neighboring units. The interiors are inspired by the golden hour at sunset: warm, elegant spaces filled with soft, natural light, creating an atmosphere of coziness and comfort.

Amenities at Solea emphasize outdoor living: landscaped gardens, swimming pools, and communal areas located on different levels, fostering social interaction and relaxation, an open-air cinema, a gym, and more.

Solea’s location is key to your convenience: 7 minutes to The Louvre Abu Dhabi, 8 minutes to the Cultural District, 19 minutes to Abu Dhabi International Airport, 8 minutes to Saadiyat Beach and Golf Club, 7-8 minutes to the St. Regis and Park Hyatt hotels, and 21 minutes to the Cleveland Clinic.

## Description
Jumeirah Zabeel Saray by Meraas Holding is an exclusive collection of 38 luxurious 4 and 5 bedroom royal residences. 

On the western shore of the man-made Palm Jumeirah Island, a magnificent palace recreating the imperial scale of the Ottoman era is set on a private beach on the azure waters of the Persian Gulf. The interior decoration matches the exterior of the building. Its walls are decorated with hand-painted frescoes in the style of Turkish masters and take you back three centuries to the era of Ahmet III. 

The infrastructure of Jumeirah Zabeel Saray Dubai impresses with a variety of services: luxurious rooms, suites and separate residences with several bedrooms and private pools; a luxurious spa complex - all in the same majestic Ottoman style; swimming pool-lagoon, tennis courts, cinema, theater, conference halls, boutiques and, of course, numerous restaurants and bars, delighting with elegant interiors, exquisite dishes of different countries and first-class drinks. 

Thanks to its proximity to Crescent Road, Royal Residences at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray is a 35-minute drive from Dubai International Airport. This highway connects Palm Jumeirah to the Dubai mainland.

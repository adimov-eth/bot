## Description
Atlantis The Royal Residences is an elite residential complex in Dubai. The complex is located on Palm Jumeirah - an artificial archipelago in the form of a date palm, at the farthest point of the island - on a breakwater in the shape of a crescent moon. The complex overlooks the bay and is close to Aquaventure Water Park and the famous luxury hotel Atlantis The Palm. 

Atlantis The Royal Residences is a 43-storey complex featuring furnished apartments with 2-5 bedrooms, as well as penthouses and garden suites. Each residence has panoramic windows and terraces.

The complex has a swimming pool, fitness center, sports field, spa, park, and barbecue area. For household issues, residents turn to the concierge service. A food market is a 5-minute walk from the complex, a Minimart grocery store is a 16-minute walk away, and Laguna Beach Taverna & Lounge is a Mediterranean restaurant. Asya's Nursery and Griddy School can be reached in 15 minutes by car. The Atlantis Aquaventure monorail stop is a 17-minute walk away, bringing islanders to the mainland. Crescent Road passes by the complex and leads to Palm Jumeirah Road, Palm's main highway. By car, it will take 25 minutes to reach the world's tallest tower, Burj Khalifa, and the largest shopping center, Dubai Mall. DXB Airport is a 30-minute drive away and Al Maktoum Airport is 37 minutes away.

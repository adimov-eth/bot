## Description
Oceano is an ultra-luxury project by The Luxe Developers, located on the picturesque Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah. The complex consists of two 18-storey towers connected to each other. It offers luxury apartments with 1-4 bedrooms, as well as exclusive penthouses.

 A unique feature of Oceano is the amazing facades of the complex, standing out among the surrounding landscape. The building has a modern futuristic shape, and the glass panels of the facades reflect the mesmerizing waters of the Persian Gulf and, especially beautiful at sunset, the rays of the sun. The interiors are finished with the highest quality materials in light colors. Panoramic windows let in an abundance of natural light and offer breathtaking views of the sea and the horizon.

 Oceano includes 12 retail units as well as premium amenities such as a spa, swimming pool overlooking the Arabian Sea, state-of-the-art gym, cigar room, library and yoga room. A separate driver's lounge is also part of the overall infrastructure.

 Another feature of the complex is its unique location. Oceano is a 30-minute drive from Ras Al Khaimah International Airport. In close proximity to the complex are such attractions as Al Marjan Island Beach, which is only 5 minutes away, and Al Hamra Mall, which is 10 minutes away.

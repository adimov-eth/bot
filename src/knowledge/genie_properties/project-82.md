## Description
Safa One is an amazing project from one of Dubai's leading developers, Damac, created and designed together with the famous jewelry designer Fawaz Gruzi, founder of the De Grisogono brand. The complex consists of two towers of 44 and 62 floors and offers 1-3 bedroom apartments with designer finishes by De Grisogono. Vibrant colors and precious stones are used in the finishes, creating new standards of sophistication and setting Safa One apart. Each residence has a private balcony and some apartments have a terrace with a private pool.

One of the features of the complex is its unique design. The fact that each balcony has a mini garden with a lush tree gives the architecture of the building a fresh look. The modern style of glass facades is combined with greenery, creating an eco-friendly atmosphere.

Residents of the complex will enjoy a wide range of amenities. Safa One offers two unique golden sand beach pools, a spa, cafes and restaurants, bicycle paths along the canal, and an amazing rooftop garden, which is 32 meters high and decorated with manicured landscapes and soaring birds.

Al Safa, one of the greenest parks in Dubai, and Dar Wasl shopping center are within walking distance of the complex. La Mer Beach is a 15-minute drive away, Dubai Mall is just 10 minutes away and Dubai Marina is about 25 minutes away.

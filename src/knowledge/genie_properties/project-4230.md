## Description
Garden Homes is a luxury villa complex on the beachfront of the world famous Palm Jumeirah Island, Dubai. The villas are located on the ‘branches of the palm tree’ B, C, D, E and M. The developer of the project is Nakheel Properties. 

Garden Homes villas in Mediterranean, Arabian, Moroccan or Greek styles have 4-5 bedrooms. Each has a private beach and swimming pool.

The villas have a ground floor entrance hall leading to a spacious living room with large panoramic windows offering beautiful views of the beach. Next to this is a large kitchen with a maid's room, laundry room and pantry. On the 2nd floor there are four bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. Most villas have covered car parks or garages.

The community is well connected with an accessible transport interchange linking it directly to Sheikh Zayed Street. The mainland of Dubai can be reached in 16 minutes. A 300 metre bridge connects villa residents to the mainland. Dubai's famous attractions can be accessed from the island by car. The Dubai Mall can be reached in 25 minutes and the Mall of the Emirates in 20 minutes. It takes approximately the same amount of time to reach the famous The Walk JBR promenade.

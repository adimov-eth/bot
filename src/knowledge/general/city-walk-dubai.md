# City Walk Dubai

## City Walk Dubai: A Blend of Urban Life and Stylish Experiences.

Jumeirah is an affluent district of Dubai that is mostly occupied by expatriates. Home to City Walk, the Jumeirah district of Dubai is an upscale destination that is a magnet for tourists as well as residents of the United Arab Emirates. 

City Walk is conveniently located near Downtown Dubai and thus, the Burj Khalifa. At the south-west side of Al Safa Road and Al Wasl Road, City Walk is in close proximity to Sheikh Zayed Road and the Dubai Mall metro station. 

Al Satwa is located towards the north of the metropolitan retail destination while the southern end is bordered by the commercial hub, Business Bay.

The F13 bus route cuts through the centre of Downtown Dubai with many bus stops dotted around the area. The Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa metro station is a commonly used means of transportation to travel within the emirate and beyond. 

Numerous registered Dubai taxis can be seen cruising through the area, scouting potential passengers. Furthermore, The Dubai Trolley travels along the Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard. The Dubai Trolley is the world’s first hydrogen-powered trolley and transports people around the area.

The majority of the City Walk Dubai apartments feature spacious hallways and large bay windows that provide spectacular views to its residents. The residential area of City Walk features over 600 parking spaces while the commercial areas showcase VIP valet services. 

The community is a social hub, highlighting events and campaigns organised all year round. Events like parties, concerts, movie nights and food festivals are regularly conducted at the City Walk residences.city-walk-dubai-area-guide-5-scaled.jpg)

# Downtown Dubai

## Downtown Dubai The Future is Now

The Downtown Dubai community has firmly cemented Dubai’s reputation as a global, dynamic city and accelerated the growth of the economy. Set in the heart of Dubai, Downtown Dubai is bordered by Sheikh Zayed Road - the main artery in the road network of Dubai - and the Financial Centre Road. 

The district could not be more perfectly positioned; it is a mere 10-minute drive to the Dubai International Airport. The Downtown Dubai apartments are in the vicinity of premium beaches, fantastic entertainment options and numerous key landmarks. 

For residents and visitors who have a car, many parking bays and podium level car parks are provided within the community. For those without a car, numerous public transport options have been provided in the Downtown Dubai area.

The F13 bus route cuts through the centre of Downtown Dubai with many bus stops dotted around the area. The Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa metro station is a commonly used means of transportation to travel within the emirate and beyond. 

Numerous registered Dubai taxis can be seen cruising through the area, scouting potential passengers. Furthermore, The Dubai Trolley travels along the Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard. 

The Dubai Trolley is the world’s first hydrogen-powered trolley and transports people around the area.

## Downtown Dubai The Peak of Excellence

The Opera District is the home of the Dubai Opera - a 2000-seat multi-format performing arts centre. The design of the iconic Dubai Opera is inspired by the sails of the Dhow-vessels from the Middle East and the Opera showcases some of the best international talents.  
  

The Dubai Mall is one of the world’s largest retail destinations. Located in the Downtown Dubai community, this mega-attraction spans over 13 million square feet and is the home of 150 luxury shopping and dining facilities. It also encompasses the exemplary Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo - a 270-degree walkthrough indoor aquarium. 

The dancing Dubai Fountains are perfectly choreographed and a joy to witness. The area continually attracts residents and visitors every day. Moreover, Downtown Dubai has a myriad of community-centred events like outdoor film festivals, concerts and weekend markets featuring local culture. 

There is never a dull moment in Downtown Dubai, and the urban community is the ideal sophisticated city hub.

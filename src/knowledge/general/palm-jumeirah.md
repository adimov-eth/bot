# Palm Jumeirah

## A Guide To Palm Jumeirah Community

The monumental Palm Jumeirah island has extended the shoreline of Dubai by 6.5 kilometres into the Arabian Gulf. Possibly the world's most extraordinary feat of engineering, the Palm Jumeirah island is located in the centre of Dubai, between Dubai Marina and the grand Burj Al Arab. 

It is also bordered by beloved residential communities of Dubai - Al Barsha, Jumeirah Lake Towers, the Greens and Al Sufouh 1. The residents of the island are privy to fantastic views of the blue waters of the open sea, Atlantis The Palm and the Burj Al Arab.

Residents of the Palm Jumeirah can experience all the luxurious facilities and amazing entertainment services located in the nearby neighbourhoods of Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina via a short 20-minute drive. 

The Dubai International Airport is also located fairly close to the island at a 23-minute drive. Even though it’s based in the heart of Dubai, entering the island feels as though you’re leaving behind the manic city life.

The area is popular for its nightlife which is lively and posh, catering to the young professionals working in the area. Weekends and weekdays evenings are busy and exciting, with youngsters finished with work, spending time with their friends in the bustling area.

## Life at the Palm Jumeirah

One of the most popular enclosures of the Palm Jumeirah is the Golden Mile Galleria, a mall that facilitates shopping, dining and leisure activities. Destinations like Club Vista Mare and Oceana Beach Club enable residents of the Palm to spend their evenings enjoying a gourmet meal set with the background of the sun setting over the gorgeous Arabian Gulf.

Additionally, almost all of these beach clubs are pet-friendly. The entire community exudes a luxury holiday feel all year round. Beach-access is available to residents of the island. The flagship luxury hotel, Atlantis The Palm, is located on the island. 

Based on the lost underwater city of Atlantis, the hotel provides world-class facilities such as gourmet restaurants, the fun-filled Aquaventure Waterpark, water sports, sea life experiences, a grand aquarium and opulent hotel suites. Residents of Palm Jumeirah can experience the epitome of comfort and luxury. 

Residents can opt not to leave their homes, instead, they can make use of the excellent laundry, grocery and food delivery services spread across the island. The exclusive residential island hosts superior homes, built with high-quality finishes and high-end facilities including fully-equipped gymnasiums, expansive swimming pools, private beach access, spas and fine-dining.

The Trunk of the island hosts most of the apartment towers, serviced apartment and low-rise buildings found on the island whilst the fronds contain most of the upscale villas with access to the beach. 

The price of the dwellings increases along the frond, as it is closer to the sea and thus offers more privacy and space. In terms of outdoor spaces, Palm Jumeirah is the home of the famous Al Ittihad Park. The park is a palm-lined promenade style destination with manicured grass and fun activities for children and adults alike. 

Al Ittihad Park is a safe place for children, with play areas located throughout. A 3.2-kilometre cycling track and a free outdoor workout space are available in the park for residents who are more athletically-inclined. 

The landscaped park is also the home of 60 species of plants and trees and offers a much-need sanctuary of greenery in the area. The Pointe at Palm Jumeirah is the latest waterfront addition to the island. It’s located at the tip of the island conglomerate and is across from Atlantis The Palm. 

The waterfront destination is the home of several dining, entertainment and retail facilities and also features a stage floating along the coast where concerts are held. The residents can get around the Palm using the Monorail, a rail specifically designed for the island. 

The route is almost 5 kilometres long and runs along the Trunk and Crescent of the island, beginning at the Gateway Station at Al Sufouh and making its way to the grand Atlantis The Palm hotel.

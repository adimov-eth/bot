## MBR City- The Future is Here

The Meydan One Mall in Dubai is the latest innovative destination for shopping and recreation. The project is set to redefine traditional retail experiences due to its retractable skylight. Once retracted, the skylight converts a spacious indoor retail destination into a stunning outdoor leisure park. 

The Meydan One Mall will feature a 1-kilometre long ski slope and a 400-metre long shopping strip. The complex will showcase over 600 stores and 100 food outlets. The engineering marvel will also highlight the iconic Meydan One Civic Plaza and an indoor aquatic park. 

The Meydan One Mall expects over 6 million visitors each year who can park in any of the 12,000 parking spaces. A leisure centre, in collaboration with Universal Studios, is in the works that will be connected to the mall.

Often representing Mohammed Bin Rashid City, Crystal Lagoon is the upcoming largest man-made lagoon in the world. The design of the Crystal Lagoon is inspired by the Caribbean and features clear aquamarine waters and palm trees on either side of the lagoon. 

The lagoon covers an impressive 7 kilometres and will offer a peaceful beachfront in the centre of MBR City. MBR City will offer a retail boardwalk, dotted with luxury shopping outlets and fantastic dining venues.

Playgrounds, health centres, medical centres and swimming pools are only some of the amenities offered near MBR City. For fitness fanatics, MBR City offers the District One Cycling and Running Track that is located on Muscat Street. 

A large central park is in development at MBR City and on completion will become the hub for all social and recreational activities at the development.
